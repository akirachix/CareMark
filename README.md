# CareMark

#**Background**

Tuberculosis is the 13th leading cause of death globally and the fourth leading cause of death in Kenya.SDG Target 3.3 includes ending the TB epidemic by 2030.The End TB Strategy defines milestones (for 2020 and 2025) and targets (for 2030 and 2035) for reductions in TB cases and deaths. The targets for 2030 are a 90% reduction in the number of TB deaths and an 80% reduction in the TB incidence rate (new cases per 100 000 population per year) compared with levels in 2015. The milestones for 2020 are a 35% reduction in the number of TB deaths and a 20% reduction in the TB incidence rate. The strategy also includes a 2020 milestone that no TB patients and their households face catastrophic costs as a result of TB disease.

#**Solution**

CareMark is a Short Messaging Service platform that aims to intervene at the TB treatment level with the main target users being TB patients from lowly resourced background owning basic feature phones. As adherence to treatment plays a major role to treatment success and mitigating the persistence of TB, CareMark is set to remind TB patients to committedly take in drugs at the prescribed time during their treatment period cycle.
